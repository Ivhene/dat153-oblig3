/**
 * A {@code PrintStream} adds functionality to another output stream,
 * namely the ability to print representations of various data values
 * conveniently.  Two other features are provided as well.  Unlike other output
 * streams, a {@code PrintStream} never throws an
 * {@code IOException}; instead, exceptional situations merely set an
 * internal flag that can be tested via the {@code checkError} method.
 * Optionally, a {@code PrintStream} can be created so as to flush
 * automatically; this means that the {@code flush} method is
 * automatically invoked after a byte array is written, one of the
 * {@code println} methods is invoked, or a newline character or byte
 * ({@code '\n'}) is written.
 *
 * <p> All characters printed by a {@code PrintStream} are converted into
 * bytes using the given encoding or charset, or platform's default character
 * encoding if not specified.
 * The {@link PrintWriter} class should be used in situations that require
 *  writing characters rather than bytes.
 *
 * <p> This class always replaces malformed and unmappable character sequences with
 * the charset's default replacement string.
 * The {@linkplain java.nio.charset.CharsetEncoder} class should be used when more
 * control over the encoding process is required.
